2. Install the extnsion by running command: `blueprint -install mcmods.blueprint`

### Step 2: Configure CurseForge

1. Create a account at CurseForge Console (https://console.curseforge.com)
2. Generate an API key
3. Paste it in the extension's settings.

# Wings Modification

You only need to perform Wings modifications if you want to use the **Manage Mods** feature (show installed mods, update mods, and remove mods).
These steps must be performed on every node running Wings and make sure you don't run the commands below inside your Pterodactyl directory (usually located at `/var/www/pterodactyl`)

### Step 1: Install Go

Go is required to build Wings. You can install it by running the command: `apt-get install -y golang`
If you are not using Debian-based system, install Go using your system's package manager.

### Step 2: Clone Wings Repository

Clone Wings repository by running command: `git clone https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings.git && cd wings`

### Step 3: Apply the Wings Patch

Upload the `wings.patch` file (included with this archive) into the Wings directory you just cloned and run command: `git apply wings.patch`

### Step 4: Build Wings

This will generate the Wings binary under the `build/` directory. Run the command: `make build`

### Step 5: Replace the Wings Binary

Stop Wings by running the command: `systemctl stop wings`

Copy the newly built binary by running the command: `cp "build/wings_linux_$(uname -m | sed -e 's/x86_64/amd64/' -e 's/aarch64/arm64/')" /usr/local/bin/wings`

Start Wings again by running the command: `systemctl start wings`
