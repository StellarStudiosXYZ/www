## Wings Modification

Wings modification is **optional** and only required if you want to use the **Manage Plugins** feature (view installed plugins, update plugins, and remove plugins).

These steps apply only to nodes running [Pterodactyl Wings](https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings) and must be completed on each node.
If you are using [Calagopus Wings](https://github.com/calagopus/wings), you can skip this section entirely — everything will work without any additional modifications.

Make sure you don't run the commands below inside your Pterodactyl directory (usually located at `/var/www/pterodactyl`)

<Steps>

<Step>
  <div className="space-y-6">

### Install GoLang

Pterodactyl Wings is written in Go, and Go is required in order to build a Wings binary. If you are using a Debian-based or Ubuntu-based distribution, install Go by running:

```bash
apt-get install -y golang
```

On other distributions, install Go using the distribution's package manager.

### Apply patch

Start by cloning the Pterodactyl Wings repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings.git pterodactyl-wings
cd pterodactyl-wings
```

Next, using an SFTP client of your choice, upload the `WingsModification.patch` file into the cloned `pterodactyl-wings` directory.

Once uploaded, apply the patch by running:

```bash
patch -Np1 -i WingsModification.patch
```

  </div>
</Step>

<Step>
  <div className="space-y-6">

### Build Wings Binary

After the patch has been applied, build the Wings binary by running:

```bash
make build
```

  </div>
</Step>

<Step>
  <div className="space-y-6">

### Replace Wings Binary

Once the build is complete, stop the currently running Wings service, replace the binary with the
newly built one, and start Wings again:

```bash
systemctl stop wings
cp "build/wings_linux_$(uname -m | sed -e 's/x86_64/amd64/' -e 's/aarch64/arm64/')" /usr/local/bin/wings
systemctl start wings
```
